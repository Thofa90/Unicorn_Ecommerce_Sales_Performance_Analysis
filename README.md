# 🎯 Goal

To analyze Unicorn’s e-commerce sales data and identify key drivers of negative profit, inefficiencies in discounting and shipping strategies, and provide actionable recommendations to improve overall profitability and customer retention.

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Between 2015 and 2018, Unicorn experienced profitability challenges despite steady sales growth. Certain products and categories consistently generated negative profit margins, while inefficient shipping methods and aggressive discount policies further reduced revenue. Without corrective measures, Unicorn risks margin erosion, customer dissatisfaction, and long-term competitiveness.

# 🔎 Google Sheet Analysis

📊 Optional Daily Monitoring Dashboard (Google Sheets)

In addition to the main analysis, I built a dynamic monitoring dashboard in Google Sheets to help the Unicorn DA team track sales and profit performance by year and region.

	• Regional KPIs: Visualized total sales, profit, and average discount per region using formulas + conditional formatting.
 
	• Category Trends: Monthly sales, profit, and profit margin calculated for each category/sub-category with supporting charts.
 
	• Dynamic Year Filter: A dedicated tab allows users to filter by year, automatically updating all metrics and charts.
 
	• Profit Dashboard:
 
		•Histogram of profit distribution with outlier handling.
		•Line/waterfall chart showing profit trend across months.
		•Top 5 & Bottom 5 profitable subcategories.
		•Top 10 & Bottom 10 customers by profitability.
  
	• Dynamic KPIs included:
 
		•✅ Sum of positive profit
		•❌ Sum of negative profit
		•📦 Number of distinct orders

This Google Sheets dashboard makes it easy for non-technical users to interactively explore profitability trends and identify problem areas in real-time.
