# 🚨 Problem Statement

Between 2015 and 2018, Unicorn experienced profitability challenges despite steady sales growth. Certain products and categories consistently generated negative profit margins, while inefficient shipping methods and aggressive discount policies further reduced revenue. Without corrective measures, Unicorn risks margin erosion, customer dissatisfaction, and long-term competitiveness.
